    <div class="title">Hello! Thank you for taking a moment to look at my portfolio</div>
    <p class="about">I am Taylor Woodman. I have loved technology ever since I was a kid.
      I knew from a young age that I wanted to have something to do with technology for the rest of my life.
      Something about it just facinated me, especially when material themes became a thing. I am happy to say
      that I am chasing my dream by becoming a web developer!

        <div class="desc">Description: Basic user management for admins, and note taking for the user.</div>
        <p>The idea behind this project was to make a separation between what the admin sees and what the user sees.
        The admin routes are all protected so that only admins can view them. The admin can update and delete users, but
        not other admins.
        They have note taking on their login as well. When the user logs in they only have their notes that theyâ€™ve
        created.</p>

          <div class="desc">Description: This application is for those who like to play pickup games but have trouble
            finding a group to do
            so.</div>
          <p>You can post, join, edit, and cancel sporting events.
          When you join the event it will add it to your calendar on your account.
          We have a chat feature for people to decide roles for the event as well as a map to show where the event is
          relative to you.
          This project really helped me learn to work in a group.</p>
